# The MAGADADDY.org Golden Rule License

Steal with style.  
Collaborate with care.  
And above all — remember the golden rule:

**Don’t be a dick.**

This project is satire. It’s art. It’s cultural reflection.  
It exists to challenge assumptions, not incite division.  
You are welcome to remix, riff, and reimagine — especially if you're a:

- Polite punk  
- Poetic pontificator  
- Curious cousin from across the aisle

But not if you're a problematic politician, rage-bait grifter, or purveyor of punch-down parody.

If you're unsure, just reach out. We're building with intent, not ego.
